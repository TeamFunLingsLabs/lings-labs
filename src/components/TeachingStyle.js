          Rather than focus on boring stuff like theory, we jump in at the deep
          end and start busting out code from the get go. If you make it this
          far, you'll learn more top dog skills and be a coding ninja in no
          time!
        </p>

          We introduce a new topic via a mini workshop, do some code together,
          then set you some high grade challenges to reinforce your
          understanding. <br />We will throw some super duper, interesting
          challenges your way once every topic comes to a sad end. This will
          make you strong my padwan. And get creatives dudes! Learn new sh*t in
          your spare time and bust them out in class to show off like a proper
          hipster.

          Each project ends in a demo where you can show off your skills and
          make everyone else feel jelous. Yeah!

            <h5>Pair Programming</h5>
            <p>
              We force you into pairs using a not-so-consistent pair generator.
              Then you can both take turns trying to figure out my coding
              exercises. Get that keyboard sanitizer ready!

            <h5>Test Driven Development</h5>
            <p>
              It may be long as sh*t to do, but we make sure you test your code
              so it, you know, actually works. Duh! <br />This way you can make
              changes to your code with a slightly decreased risk of messing
              everything up and sh*tting yourself at red warnings in developer
              tools!
