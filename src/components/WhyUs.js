          Apart from being absolute ballers within the industry, we excel at
          teaching leading languages and technologies to our jedis-in-training.
          We specialise in:

            <h4>JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
              There are countless programming languages for developers to choose
              from. Some like Ruby are easier to learn but now face limited
              demand in the industry. <br />We focus specifically on JavaScript
              along with React library and Node framework. JavaScript is in the
              enviable position of being the ONLY programming language that runs
              natively in the browser. <br />As a result, any web application
              that wants to provide users with a rich, interactive experience
              must use it.

            <h4>React & Node</h4>
            <p>
              The React library makes it incredibly easy to create amazing
              interfaces while keeping code well structured, maintainable and
              performant. Node is a framework which allows JavaScript to also be
              run on the server, which allows us to create a full-stack
              application using a single language. <br />This allows developers
              to not only share code between the client and the server, but also
              makes development much easier since we can utilise the same skill
              set for both parts of the application. <br />Historically,
              software development teams were split between front end and back
              end. Using the latest JavaScript technologies companies can now
              create entire features end-to-end using the same developers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The future is bloody bright, yo!</h4>
            <p>
              The JavaScript language also keeps evolving. Functionality added
              in ES6, ES7 and ES8 standards have made it easier to write clean
              and robust code which is much simpler to work with. <br />All the
              leading technology companies are now putting JavaScript at the
              center of their software development. <br />If you want to acquire
              a skill set that will provide with a satisfying and future-proof
              career choice then you simply cannot choose a better course to
              make that happen for you.
